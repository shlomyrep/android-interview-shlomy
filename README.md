# android-interview-shlomy
This is an example app for a job interview
The task could have been done with the moviedb java lib.
I'v felt the need to do it with the json api so i could practice it a bit.
I wanted to add features like trailers from youtube but didn't have enough time.
Had fun building this project, but it's not completed and demands many improvments.
